        Hi! My name is Tomas. I'm a Full-stack Developer from Argentina. <br /> I
        finished my studies being in the TOP 10 of the course, thanks to the fact
        that I love programming and development, and that I was always inclined towards
        self-taught education, seeking to learn something new every day.
